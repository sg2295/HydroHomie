# HydroHomie ðŸ¥¤
A semester-long, group-based coursework in Java. 
(Backend: Java, Frontend: Java Swing)

To develop this application we followed a SCRUM (Agile) development model. The application provides a way for the user to keep track of their daily water consumption, by tracking their drinking habits and displaying it in a convenient way. To run the project using the graphical-user interface, as intended, use the *HydroHomie.jar* file.

My responsibilities included introducing the front-end team to Swing and overseeing their progress, integrating the back and front ends of the application, and designing as well as carrying out tests. Despite focusing on these components, I also had the opportunity to participate in every stage of the Software Lifecycle.

My heavy involvement in both ends of the application allowed me to get a wholistic view of the development process, and better delegate tasks to team members in subsequent sprints. During the middle stages of development, due to the coronavirus epidemic, team members had to work remotely. The project was awarded a high-ranking grade (First).
